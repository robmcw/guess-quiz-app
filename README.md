## Guess quiz app

A quiz app, created with Next. Play it here: https://guess-quiz-app.vercel.app/

The concept was born out of a quiz that I took that involved matching quantities of various things (radioactive dose on exposure, personal wealth, population), to scenarios. It felt like something that would fit nicely into a Next.js app and test my skills.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
